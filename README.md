What's rUWDEL? (ruwdel.info)

rUWDEL(russo-Ukrainian War Documented Equipment Losses) is API focused web resourse to see and analyze all the documented losses happened since February 22, 2022 in Ukraine and russia.

Data is scraped and sorted with help of Daniel Scarnecchia's scraper tool and Lee Drake's repo.

All the equipment in the list is documented and verified, but it doesn't mean that it represents all the losses. According to experts' analysis it represents from 40 to 70% of all losses and forms absolute minimum baseline for estimates.

If you're interested in analitycs or more acurate information about regions, dates, timeline - please visit Warspotting and ORYX

Our resourse is just scraped data from Oryx and sorted for slightly easier navigation for API.

What's important to know? rUWDEL does not guarantee 100% acurate information.

All the dates are representing the date photo was verified and published on Oryx, not the date of actual loss.

Some of the losses could be showed twice or a few times with different statuses. Especially in requests by date.
